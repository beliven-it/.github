## Etiquette

This project is open source. The maintainers dedicate their free time to building, improving, and maintaining the codebase, making it freely available for everyone to use. Their contribution is an act of generosity, and they hope the project will be helpful to others.

When interacting with maintainers (e.g., opening issues or submitting pull requests), please be respectful and considerate. Remember:
- Open source thrives on collaboration and mutual respect.
- Feedback and reviews are intended to promote quality, not personal criticism.
- If your contribution is not accepted, avoid frustrationâ€”decisions are made based on the benefit to the project and its broader audience.

Letâ€™s collaborate constructively and showcase how developers support one another!

## Contribution Guidelines

### Reporting Issues and Requesting Features

Before creating an issue:
1. **Replicate the problem** youâ€™re experiencing to ensure it isnâ€™t a one-time occurrence.
2. **Search existing issues** to check if it has already been reported or discussed.
3. **Verify ongoing work** by checking pull requests to see if:
   - There is already a solution in progress.
   - The feature you want to request is already being implemented.

When opening an issue:
- Provide a **clear and detailed description** of the problem or feature request.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Share any relevant logs, screenshots, or additional details to help with debugging or understanding the request.

### Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome contributions to the codebase via pull requests! Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. **Check for previous work**:
   - Verify that your feature or fix has not already been submitted as a pull request.
   - Make sure the codebase doesnâ€™t already include your change.

2. **Stick to one change per pull request**:
   - If you plan to address multiple features or fixes, open separate pull requests for each one.

3. **Ensure a clear commit history**:
   - Each commit should represent a meaningful change.
   - If you have multiple commits for a single feature or fix, [squash](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) them into one before submitting.

4. **Add tests**:
   - Contributions without tests will not be accepted.
   - Ensure that your tests cover all edge cases and maintain the quality of the project.

5. **Keep documentation updated**:
   - Update `README.md` and any other relevant documents to reflect your changes.

6. **Consider the release cycle**:
   - Follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer v2.0.0)](http://semver.org/) guidelines to avoid breaking public APIs without clear justification.
